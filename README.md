# ReaVaya Bus Service Web App

## Goal
The goal is to create a seamless experience for existing as well as new users of the bus service through the development of a user-friendly web application to manage accounts, access bus routes and schedules, perform account top-ups, and check balances for public transportation users.

## Chosen Theme
Enhanced service deliverygitt

## The Problem
As a regular user of the ReaVaya buses, I am disheartened at the fact that the survice does not have any application to help with oneâ€™s usage of the bus service, especially considering there are quite a number of younger people using the service. This is a whole market that is not benign spoken to directly by ReaVaya and they lack platforms upon which to voice their concerns.
